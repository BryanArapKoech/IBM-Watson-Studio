# SpaceX DataSet 
The job is to determine the price of each rocket launch. This is achieved by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for the team. An important task is to determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, a machine learning model is trained using public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
